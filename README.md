## What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar and can be solved using any programming language. Each puzzle is released at midnight in Eastern Standard Time and consists of two parts that must be solved in order. Participants also compete based on speed on both global and private leaderboards.
